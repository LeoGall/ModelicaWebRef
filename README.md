Overview
========

This repository contains all the source material for the Modelica
Quick Reference card [hosted by Xogeny](http://modref.xogeny.com).

Goals
=====

It is impossible to cram the entire Modelica specification
into this quick reference card.

The goals of this quick reference card are:

  * To provide a distilled version of what is in the specification.
  * To be relatively complete with respect to the keywords, operators,
    types, functions and annotations defined in the specification.
  * To provide links back to the relevant sections of the
    specification when the detail included here is not sufficient.
  * To keep all information within one click for users (i.e. no deep
    hierarchies of organizational structure).
  * Provide a way for people to learn about features in Modelica they
    were no previously aware of without having to read the entire
    specification.

Contributions
=============

I very much welcome any feedback or contributions to this card.  If I
implement any of your suggestions, I will gladly list you in the
acknowledgments section.

The simplest way to accept a contribution (i.e. correction or
improvement) to this card is via pull request.  Alternatively, you can
submit an issue to [the issue
tracker](http://github.com/xogeny/ModelicaWebRef/issues).

The reference was developed under Linux although it should be possible
to "assemble" the complete web page on any system that has a copy of
Python with the Jinja2 extension install.  The script 'autobuild.sh' is
useful while editing the source material because it triggers a rebuild
of the main page for every modification of the source material.

avoid a proliferation of slightly different (or worse, erroneous)
reference cards.  By having one "master" copy of this reference, my
hope is to keep all improvements funneled into this master copy.

**Note**: For the purpose of these licensing terms, I will not
	  consider a Fork on GitHub to be a derived work.  Feel free

	  republications of the completely assembed web page.

Of course, this is a Creative Commons license so you can feel free to
share or distribute copies of the master version.
